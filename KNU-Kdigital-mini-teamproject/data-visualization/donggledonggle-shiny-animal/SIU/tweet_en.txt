https://t.co/ZV3BauM0kPThis’s a @CBCGDF_China Community Conservation Area for Ili #Pika in #Xinjiang, #China.

With a decade of consistent conservation efforts, the #endangered #species came into public awareness, &amp; listed as 2nd grade national protected species 2021. But not enough - actually it’s CR https://t.co/XL8TmPYqvrMy career entailed actually saving species we thought had in fact disappeared and were presumed extinct.

Its pretty exciting to bring species back from the Brink of Extinction........
